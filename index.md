# **Ruby Pong**

## Here is a Ruby version of the classic Pong video game.

### Have some fun with this original classic, Ruby style!


The object of the game is to prevent your opponent from scoring a point by getting the ball to bounce back to your side and getting past your paddle. If the ball makes it past your paddle, and hits the edge of the game window on your side, your opponent will score a point!


Some features that I would like to implement are:
* a menu where you can enter the name of each player;
* the option to pause the game;
* _powerups_ that are gained by skillful maneuvering, such as being able to "**rocket**" the ball towards your opponent, and another that enlarges your paddle, thus giving you an advantage;
* a high-score list


This is my first Ruby project, and also my first GitHub repo (besides the one created by the GitHub tutorial), so it may take me some time to add these features; check back every once in a while for updates!
